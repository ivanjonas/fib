I can't believe that I actually messed up such a simple interview question. I got the algorithm right, but totally messed up the interfaces and failed to optimize my code. As penance, I'm doing this.

Just run `npm install` and `npm test` to see the output. If all the tests passed, I have redeemed myself.
